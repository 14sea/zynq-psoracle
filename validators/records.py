# STOP_ARM: an ARM was written and the PL did not consume it — the nonce did not step.
# Added as INSTRUMENTATION after session 1 (2026-09-01), where the board entered exactly
# this state and the schema could not express it: REFUSED_BY_PL requires the nonce to have
# stepped, so the application had no legal record to emit and the observations were lost.
# It records that the state occurred; it asserts NOTHING about why, and no other rule is
# relaxed to accommodate it.
# STOP_SETTLE: the strobe was written and the bounded poll of STATUS exhausted its budget
# without the gate settling (busy never cleared, or nothing latched). Added after session 3
# (2026-09-01), which showed that the application had been reading the nonce while
# `gate_busy` was still set: the RTL steps the nonce only when the SipHash completes
# (rtl/p3_arm_gate.v state 1, `sh_done`), so an immediate read cannot see it. Every ARM
# record now carries `settle` — the poll's count, bound, first and last STATUS — and
# STOP_ARM means "the gate SETTLED and the nonce did not step", which is a different fact
# from "we did not wait". STOP_SETTLE is neutral: it consumes the nonce in the chain iff the
# nonce is observed stepped, forbids a score, and claims nothing about why.
# STOP_AUDIT (L6 pull protocol, docs/l6_audit_pull_design.md): the host-paced audit of a
# candidate that had staged and read back could not be completed (retries exhausted, the
# host aborted, or the board's bounded wait for the host ran out) BEFORE the ARM. The
# application then makes no ARM attempt and the epoch stops (restore, TERM). The record
# carries the oracle self-report and can never be marked audited, so the sampled and the
# all-self-reporting policies both refuse the log: it is always a HOLD, never a pass.
