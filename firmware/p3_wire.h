/* p3_wire — the standalone application's wire serialisation, as a pure unit.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The first L5 board attempt was blocked because the C
 * application's framed output had never been checked against the host validator that
 * consumes it: records were emitted flat (no `seq`, no `verified`, no nested `evidence`),
 * no `IDENT` was ever sent although `validate_standalone_run_log` requires `app_identity`,
 * and no heartbeat was sent although the collector calls 30 s of silence a CRASH. The
 * host-only rehearsal had validated `host/l5_refloop.py` -- the *Python* reference -- so
 * every test was green while the C wire format was incompatible.
 *
 * The fix is structural, and it is the same move `p3_derive.c` already makes for the
 * hashes: everything provable on the host lives in a unit with no MMIO and no board
 * dependency, so a host test can compile THIS source, drive it, and feed the bytes it
 * produces to the real Python validator (`tests/test_firmware_wire_contract.py`). What
 * stays in `p3_app.c` is the HAL and the state machine. A green test here is therefore
 * evidence about the bytes the board will actually emit, not about a model of them.
 *
 * Every builder writes compact JSON with sorted keys into a caller buffer and returns the
 * length, or 0 if it would not fit (callers treat 0 as a PROTOCOL-class failure and never
 * emit a truncated line).
